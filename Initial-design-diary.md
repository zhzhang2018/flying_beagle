I've been having an idea about an anti-meta bot. Now it's time to make some serious commitments. 

# Initial idea
- Name: FLYING BEAGLE
- Namesake: [FLYING BEAGLE}(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHOn8u-c2wk) (Himiko Kikuchi album)
- Weapon type:
  - "Lifter". It's not designed to be a lifter (but would be nice if it can be extended to a lifter), but more like a pair of keep-off arms. Like the "de-ICEr" of Ghost Raptor.
  - Rear-mounted horizontal blade, if weight allows.
- Why these weapons?
  - I want something that goes against the fork meta. Instead of playing the ground game, I want the chassis to be hollow in the front, so that if forks get underneath it, it won't disrupt anything.
  - Then the design would also need to counter the wedge meta. So the idea is to use a pair of arms to touch the wedges. Usually vert weapons' diameter is smaller than 3in, I assume (beater bars are 2.5"), so a pair of arms that reach out for longer than 3"/2 = 1.5" may be able to keep them from touching my bot.
  - But I'm not confident to win the control game as a very inexperienced driver whose previous bots all had weak or rarely controllable drivetrains.
  - So, in case the "lifter" design scores a pin, then the rear horizontal can still score some damage points by side-swiping. Kind of like Minimizer.
 
## More thoughts on the lifter design

## More thoughts on the horizontal design

There are 2 inspirations at this moment: Minimizer (or one of the similar bots), and The Chilli Daddy.

Notes from Minimizer design:
#### The wheels must be as up front as possible. 
Otherwise, when I spin the bot at a pin, the weapon won't be able to hit the opponent's side.

Due to the prior restriction, there's one more:
#### The bot can only have 2 wheels.
So that the center of spin resides as far away from the weapon as possible. 

Notes from The Chilly Daddy. design:

#### Chassis needs to be rigid enough to house a horizontal!
The Chilli Daddy. uses a CNC'd UHMW billet, I assume. That sounds rigid enough, because FTBBs usually do the same thing.
